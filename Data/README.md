This directory contains four data files:

- RandomFastSpeed1.txt
- RandomFastSpeed2.txt
- RandomSlowSpeed1.txt
- RandomSlowSpeed2.txt

Each file contains three columns which are tab delimited and contain the
measured pitch moment [Nm] and belt velocity [m/s] at the given time [s]. The
first line is the header. Each data file represents a single unloaded trial.
"Fast" corresponds to a nominal belt speed of 2 m/s and "Slow" corresponds to a
nominal belt speed of 1.2 m/s.
